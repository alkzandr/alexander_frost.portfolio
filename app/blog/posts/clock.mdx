For this project I developed a simple clock timer system to test my ability to do state logic as apposed to using integrated circuits like the NE555 Timer IC.

## Design
The design for the timer was simple, I wanted to use basic logic gates to create a device that simply counts the states, the decimal system transfers the logic to the next 7 segment display when it reaches it's maximum

## Conclusion

This design was simple yet interesting and surprisingly challenging enough to keep me interested. I also loved learning to use Virtual Circuit Board as it make the designs very visually appealing.
