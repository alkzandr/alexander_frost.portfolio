title: 'Banking API, JSON data and Terminal User Interfaces'

summary: 'Use of the Up Bank API to create a terminal client to check my spending and saving bank balance'
---

Since Up Bank is an online bank, it is primarily app-based and thus is a "mobile-only product", meaning that does not have a banking website accessible from a laptop or PC.
For this reason I decided to make a Teminal User Interface (TUI) to make it easy for me to check bank balance when making purchases on my laptop without needing my phone.
This project aims to teach me the fundamentals of:
* Fetching data from an API
* Parsing JSON data into structs in rust
* Developing a simple user interface to interact with the data

## Requesting data from the API

## Deserialising data from JSON

```rust
#[derive(Debug, Deserialize, Serialize)]  // Add Serialize trait
struct Balance {
    #[serde(rename = "currencyCode")]
    currency_code: String,
    value: String,
    #[serde(rename = "valueInBaseUnits")]
    value_in_base_units: i32,
}

#[derive(Debug, Deserialize, Serialize)]  // Add Serialize trait
struct AccountAttributes {
    #[serde(rename = "displayName")]
    display_name: String,
    #[serde(rename = "accountType")]
    account_type: String,
    #[serde(rename = "ownershipType")]
    ownership_type: String,
    balance: Balance,
    #[serde(rename = "createdAt")]
    created_at: String,
}

#[derive(Debug, Deserialize, Serialize)]  // Add Serialize trait
struct Account {
    #[serde(rename = "id")]
    account_id: String,
    #[serde(rename = "attributes")]
    attributes: AccountAttributes,
}

#[derive(Debug, Deserialize, Serialize)]  // Add Serialize trait
struct ApiResponse {
    data: Vec<Account>,
}
```
